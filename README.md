This is a pretty old c# based CMS. Originally written in .NET 2.0 and migrated to .NET 4.0 some years ago.

I'd like to use this project in the upcomming Twitch streams to show how to migrate an old project to ASP.NET Core. This CMS is kinda special, because it doesn't use common ASP.NET concepts like WebForms or MVC. It renders the HTML directly to the output streams, which makes it super fast. I'd like to take over this concept in the new ASP.NEt Core version, which should absolutely match the ASP.NET Core concepts using middlewares.

Feel free do diskuss that on Twitch and to learn how I will migrate it to ASP.NET Core 3.0.
